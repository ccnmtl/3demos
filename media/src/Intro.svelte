        Welcome to 3Demos. This is a site dedicated to visualizations for
        multivariable calculus. There are essentially two ways in which one can
        interact with the site, what your might call "story mode" and "creative
        mode".
    </p>

    <p>
        In story mode, the user can select a topic from the "ToC" menu above. A mix
        of theory, examples, and exercises are presented along with relevant
        graphical objects. Some interactive elements are embedded in the text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Creative mode can be accessed via the <i class="fa fa-sliders" /> icon in the
        upper-right. Here, one can create (and destroy) as many of the objects as one
        pleases. Note that hardware limitations may affect performance.

        Finally, I must acknowledge the pioneering work of Paul Seeburger and his
        <a href="https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html">CalcPlot3D</a>
        project, which covers much of the functionality of this site, did it first,
        and does it better.
